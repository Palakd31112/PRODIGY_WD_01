HTML:
Defines the structure of the landing page with a header, a call-to-action (CTA) section, testimonials, and a footer.
Includes an image and a button in the CTA section.
CSS:
Styles the landing page with responsive and visually appealing design elements.
JavaScript:
Adds interactivity to the CTA button, such as showing an alert when clicked.
You can replace the alert with more complex interactions, such as form submissions or page redirection.
This basic example can be expanded with more advanced features, such as forms for collecting user information, advanced animations, or more complex interactive elements.
